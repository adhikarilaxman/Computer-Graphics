# OpenGL Computer Graphics Program

This repository contains a basic OpenGL program developed in C++ for computer graphics applications. The program demonstrates fundamental concepts of OpenGL and can be used as a foundation for more complex graphical projects.

## Features

- Implements basic computer graphics using OpenGL.
- Provides a framework to experiment with graphical objects, transformations, and rendering techniques.
- Written in C++ for better performance and control.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- OpenGL libraries and headers.
- A suitable IDE or text editor (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or VS Code).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/adhikarilaxman/Computer-Graphics.git>
 


## How It Works

- **Main Functionality**: The program initializes an OpenGL window, sets up a basic rendering pipeline, and renders graphical objects on the screen.
- **Key Concepts**: Includes drawing primitives, transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), and interaction with user inputs.
