# OpenGL Computer Graphics Program

This repository contains a basic OpenGL program developed in C++ for computer graphics applications. The program demonstrates fundamental concepts of OpenGL and can be used as a foundation for more complex graphical projects.

## Features

- Implements basic computer graphics using OpenGL.
- Provides a framework to experiment with graphical objects, transformations, and rendering techniques.
- Written in C++ for better performance and control.

## Programs Included

1. **Arithmetic Symbol**: Displays various arithmetic symbols graphically.
2. **Display Different Characters**: Renders different characters on the screen.
3. **Doctor Symbol using Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm**: Draws a doctor symbol using Bresenham's algorithm.
4. **House using Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm**: Creates a graphical representation of a house using Bresenham's algorithm.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- OpenGL libraries and headers.
- A suitable IDE or text editor (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or VS Code).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/adhikarilaxman/Computer-Graphics>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <https://github.com/adhikarilaxman/Computer-Graphics.git>
   ```

3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   g++ -o program main.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
   ```

   Replace `main.cpp` with the name of your source file.

4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./program
   ```

## How It Works

- **Main Functionality**: The program initializes an OpenGL window, sets up a basic rendering pipeline, and renders graphical objects on the screen.
- **Key Concepts**: Includes drawing primitives, transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), and interaction with user inputs.
